    "Establish a clean Affinity baseline with one owner, one verified identity, and the minimum structure needed for later evidence and review work.",
  content: `# Bootstrap And Cold Start

Primary tools:
- \`manage_contact\`
- \`manage_identity\`
- \`inspect_affinity_item\`
- \`review_affinity\`

Goal:
- Establish one clean owner record, make it reachable, and verify the system is ready for later relationship work.

When to use:
- The database is new or logically empty.
- A harness needs to initialize its own operator profile before doing anything else.

When not to use:
- The owner already exists and you only need to update profile fields.
- You are importing historical relationships; use the import-focused skill after bootstrap.

Step-by-step sequence:
1. Assume the schema is already initialized and the database is live before using any tool.
2. Use \`manage_contact\` with \`action: "create"\` and \`bootstrapOwner: true\` exactly once for the operator.
3. Immediately attach at least one routing identity with \`manage_identity\` so future lookups can use a stable natural key.
4. Use \`inspect_affinity_item\` with \`kind: "owner_profile"\` to confirm that the owner profile exists and reads back cleanly.
5. Use \`review_affinity\` with \`view: "contacts.list"\` to confirm that the portfolio is still minimal and no duplicate owner-like records were created during setup.

Validation checks:
- The owner profile loads successfully.
- The owner has at least one live identity.
- The contact list shows exactly the records you expect at this early stage.

Pitfalls:
- Do not create a non-owner placeholder and plan to convert it later if the harness can bootstrap the real owner immediately.
- Do not skip identity attachment, or later natural-key lookup will be weaker and duplicate-prone.
- Do not seed relationships before the owner exists if later evidence is meant to be owner-facing.

Tips and tricks:
- Prefer an identity that is stable across sessions, such as a primary email or canonical profile URL.
- Keep the first dataset tiny. Bootstrap is for a trustworthy base, not a full import.
- If setup feels ambiguous, inspect first and add less rather than more.

Tool calls to prefer:
- \`manage_contact\` for owner creation
- \`manage_identity\` for first routing key
- \`inspect_affinity_item\` for confirmation
- \`review_affinity\` for early portfolio sanity checks
